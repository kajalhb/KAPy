Climate models outputs are often split into timeslices that need to be joined back together before use. This regular expression can be used to identify the parts of a filename (the 'stem' in KAPy language) that act as unique identifiers for the data source, and can therefore be used as a basis for grouping. Stems are identified as matching group, in brackets. e.g. `^tas_(.*)_.*?.nc$`. Note that scenario (or 'experiment') identifiers are handled separately, and should be included as part of the regex. Dates and timestamps, on the other hand, should be excluded.",
